# Project Description

Creating an interactive webpage where an investor may look up a prediction of future closing stock prices based on a ticker symbol. The prediction will be created using deep learning models and LSTM neural networks.

# Datasets to Be Used
-Yahoo Finance

-Kaggle US Stock Market Data 

-Polygon API

-Nasdaq

# Tasks
- Data pull:
Web scraping model allowed us to find historical stock price openings and closings and earnings data.
- ETL

- Database Management: 
We used SQL lite to create our database.
- Machine Learning:
We used yfinance to pull date according to the different tickers selected and based on a specific date.
We plotted the data using matplotlib
We used LSTM Model for training and testing the data. The average of the stock prices was used to train the data. 
We made predictions based on historical data.
We also used ARIMA Model to predict the stock price. 
Limitations: 
ARIMA Model does not allow to save, but it creates a pdf
ARIMA Model is faster compared to the other models. 

- User Interface:
We used Flask
